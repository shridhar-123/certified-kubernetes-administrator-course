# Resource Limits
  - Take me to [Video Tutorials](https://kodekloud.com/topic/resource-limits/)
  
In this section we will take a look at Resource Limits

#### Let us take a look at 3 node kubernetes cluster.
- Each node has a set of CPU, Memory and Disk resources available.
- If there is no sufficient resources available on any of the nodes, kubernetes holds the scheduling the pod. You will see the pod in pending state. If you look at the events, you will see the reason as insufficient CPU.

## Resource Requirements
- By default, K8s assume that a pod or container within a pod requires **`0.5`** CPU and **`256Mi`** of memory. This is known as the **`Resource Request` for a container**.

- If your application within the pod requires more than the default resources, you need to set them in the pod definition file.

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: simple-webapp-color
    labels:
      name: simple-webapp-color
  spec:
   containers:
   - name: simple-webapp-color
     image: simple-webapp-color
     ports:
      - containerPort:  8080
     resources:
       requests:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "1"
  ```

## Resources - Limits
- By default, k8s sets resource limits to 1 CPU and 512Mi of memory
  
  ![rsl](../../images/rsl.PNG)
  
- You can set the resource limits in the pod definition file.
  
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: simple-webapp-color
    labels:
      name: simple-webapp-color
  spec:
   containers:
   - name: simple-webapp-color
     image: simple-webapp-color
     ports:
      - containerPort:  8080
     resources:
       requests:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "1"
       limits:
         memory: "2Gi"
         cpu: "2"
  ```

#### Note: Remember Requests and Limits for resources are set per container in the pod.
  
## Exceed Limits
- what happens when a pod tries to exceed resources beyond its limits?

A quick note on editing PODs and Deployments
Edit a POD
Remember, you CANNOT edit specifications of an existing POD other than the below.

spec.containers[*].image
spec.initContainers[*].image
spec.activeDeadlineSeconds
spec.tolerations
For example you cannot edit the environment variables, service accounts, resource limits (all of which we will discuss later) of a running pod. But if you really want to, you have 2 options:

1. Run the kubectl edit pod <pod name> command.  This will open the pod specification in an editor (vi editor). Then edit the required properties. When you try to save it, you will be denied. This is because you are attempting to edit a field on the pod that is not editable.



A copy of the file with your changes is saved in a temporary location as shown above.

You can then delete the existing pod by running the command:

kubectl delete pod webapp

Then create a new pod with your changes using the temporary file

kubectl create -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-ccvrq.yaml

2. The second option is to extract the pod definition in YAML format to a file using the command

kubectl get pod webapp -o yaml > my-new-pod.yaml

Then make the changes to the exported file using an editor (vi editor). Save the changes

vi my-new-pod.yaml

Then delete the existing pod

kubectl delete pod webapp

Then create a new pod with the edited file

kubectl create -f my-new-pod.yaml

Edit Deployments
With Deployments you can easily edit any field/property of the POD template. Since the pod template is a child of the deployment specification,  with every change the deployment will automatically delete and create a new pod with the new changes. So if you are asked to edit a property of a POD part of a deployment you may do that simply by running the command

kubectl edit deployment my-deployment
